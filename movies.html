                <p>Ocean Waves was Studio Ghibli's attempt to allow its younger staff to showcase their movie-making talents and although what they manage to put on screen is a fascinating & surprisingly mature take on high school romance, it lacks the refined quality that could have hurled it into the leagues of the studio's best works.</p>
                <p>Based on the novel of the same name, the story of Ocean Waves follows a young college kid who's returning home after his first year at university but after glimpsing a familiar girl at the train station, recalls his senior year of high school when that same girl transferred to his school from Tokyo and turned his life upside down.</p>
                <p>Directed by Saeko Himuro, the plot is always focused on the characters & their relationships, all of which is portrayed in a very subtle & authentic manner. Its hand-drawn animation may not rival the best works of the studio but it still carries their quality stamp on it. The story is grounded & lifelike, and it never tries to do more than it can handle.</p>
                <p>Of the three people caught in the love triangle, it is the character of Rikako Muto who exhibits the most interesting arc. Her behaviour & actions add an element of mystery in the story and it unfurls very gradually. The backdrop setting is splendidly detailed at all times. However, despite being only 72 minutes long, the film still feels somewhat stretched out.</p>
                <p>On an overall scale, Ocean Waves is a gentle meditation on teen relationships and is brought to life with sufficient care, affection & sincerity. Working as both an intriguing coming-of-age drama & a muted love story, Studio Ghibli's first & only TV feature still remains their least seen work and even though it is no match to their greatest efforts, it nonetheless deserves a watch or two.</p>
